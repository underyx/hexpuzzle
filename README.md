# Solving a Math Puzzle When You're Bad at Math

This is all the source code I had for my talk with the above title at the
[June 2015 budapest.py meetup](http://www.meetup.com/budapest-py/events/222822762/).

To see the presentation yourself, please visit
[hexpuzzle.underyx.me](https://hexpuzzle.underyx.me). Advance the slides with
the spacebar. Also, don't go backwards, that will break everything :D

I did not bother cleaning up, and the entire thing is just horribly written â€”
it was my first time using genetic algorithms, reveal.js, React, Sass, lodash,
and even most parts of JavaScript. Also, I was in quite a hurry to be done with
this before the meetup. Anyway, the point is, **please do not refer to this code
when learning any of these technologies!** I had no idea what I was doing, and
made tons of mistakes.

## Usage

All dependencies are vendored, so you can just start serving from the root
directory of the repository (for instance, with `python3 -m http.server`). The
SCSS file is also included as a compiled CSS one.

Also included is the script I talked about in the presentation, `hexpuzzle.py`.
